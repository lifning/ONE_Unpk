One of the first C++ programs I ever wrote, back in 2005.
Extracts and packs .ONE files from Sonic Heroes and Shadow the Hedgehog.

The .ONE format is an archive of files each compressed with the same algorithm the .PRS files found on Saturn and Dreamcast games use.
There are a few different versions of the .ONE format in different games, but they all ultimately boil down to a simple-enough Table of Contents followed by compressed file data.
